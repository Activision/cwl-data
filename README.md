# Call of Duty World League Data

This is the public release of data from the Call of Duty World League.  The first release is game data from the 2017 Call of Duty World League Championships played in Orlando, FL from Aug 9 - Aug 13, 2017.

## The Data

Data from the following tournaments is available (see [Data](data)):

 * 2017
    * CWL Champs - Aug 9-13, 2017
 * 2018
    * CWL Dallas - Dec 8-10, 2017
    * CWL New Orleans - Jan 12-14, 2018


## How do we get it? Where does it come from?

Data is captured live during Call of Duty World League tournaments directly from the game host console.  It is cleaned, validated for correctness, and processed into a useable format.  Exports in both [tabular](data#tabular-data) and [structured](data#structured-data) format are published here.


## Collaboration

Releasing the data is just the first step.  We hope to inspire research into player performance and the creation of new more predictive stats for not just Call of Duty, but any FPS esport.  We look forward to seeing what the community can discover.


## Contributing

In addition to the data release, we also include few open source tools for basic aggregation and analysis (see [Tools](tools)).  We welcome contributions of new tools or new features for existing tools.  See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to help.
