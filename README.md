# Call of Duty World League Data

This is the public release of data from the Call of Duty World League.  The first release is game data from the 2017 Call of Duty World League Championships played in Orlando, FL from Aug 9 - Aug 13.

## The Data

The first data release is simply per-player per-game stats for every game in the tournament.

Data from the following tournaments is available:

## Missing Data

Perfect data integrity is a challenge in any environment, and Call of Duty is no different.  Anything from a power outage to a hardware failure to just plain bad luck can cause data to be lost.
