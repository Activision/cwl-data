## How do we get it? Where does it come from?

Data is captured live during Call of Duty World League tournaments directly from the various game host consoles on the LAN.  It is cleaned, validated for correctness, and processed into a useable format.  Exports in both [tabular](data#tabular-data) and [structured](data#structured-data) formats are published here.


## Collaboration

Releasing the data is just the first step.  We hope to inspire research into player performance and the creation of new more predictive stats for not just Call of Duty, but any FPS esport.  We look forward to seeing what the community can discover.


## Contributing

In addition to the data release, we also include few open source tools for basic aggregation and analysis (see [Tools](tools)).  We welcome contributions of new tools or new features for existing tools.  See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to help.
